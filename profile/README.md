## Project Introduction: AI-Powered To-Do List Application

DEMO: [https://todo.putianai.me/](https://todo.putianai.me/)

This project showcases the development of a robust and scalable to-do list application built using a cutting-edge technology stack. Leveraging the power of FastAPI for a high-performance backend and a responsive React frontend optimized with Vite, the application ensures rapid development and efficient rendering. 

Seamless integration between the frontend and backend is achieved through OpenAPI specifications, promoting code maintainability and facilitating robust API documentation.  Furthermore, the application is currently being enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to introduce intelligent task planning and scheduling capabilities. This involves researching machine learning models for task prioritization based on user behavior and deadlines, with the ultimate goal of optimizing user productivity and streamlining workflow management.

The application features an intuitive and user-friendly interface designed with modern UI/UX principles to ensure efficient task management.  Accessibility and responsiveness across various devices are prioritized, empowering users to effortlessly organize, prioritize, and track their daily activities.

On the technical side, the project demonstrates a commitment to using modern and optimized libraries, including Jotai for lightweight and performant state management in the React frontend.  A test-driven development (TDD) methodology ensures high code quality and comprehensive test coverage across both frontend and backend components.  Unit and integration tests are implemented using pytest and Vitest, a blazingly fast unit testing framework, to guarantee application reliability and robustness.

This project highlights a strong understanding of modern web development technologies, a commitment to building high-performance and reliable applications, and a forward-thinking approach to incorporating AI for enhanced user experience and productivity.
